This new version of my Turbo shroud is based off of Olof Ogland's well-thought-out Mini-AfterLGX Lite: https://www.bondtech.se/product/mini-after-lgx-lite-upgrade-kit-for-voron-v0/

# What's new?
In addition to keeping all (or most) of the features on the Mini AfterLGX Lite, this new shroud boasts lower airflow restrictions, CFD-optimized internal ducting, and more even air distribution, all of which significantly improve overall performance.

The current upper duct requires either a taller tophat or an open-frame printer (no panels), so if you want to keep the stock tophat height like with the Sherpa version, you're going to need to wait a little bit.

# What hotends/extruders does this support?
It is the Mini AfterLGX Lite, so it stands that this really only supports the LGX Lite. But just like with it's originating shroud, this new design accomodates all the hotend fan and mounting options the Mini AfterLGX Lite offers (the Mosquito and Copperhead may be a tad tight, though).

The BOM is nearly identical to the stock shroud, so follow Bondtech's instructions for assembly and BOM: https://www.bondtech.se/product/mini-after-lgx-lite-upgrade-kit-for-voron-v0/

# Can I get the CAD?
I will only have the STEP posted; I will not be posting the Fusion 360 file publicly simply because the timeline is attrocious. If you want the F3D file, let me know. I am doing this on my own time, so if you *really* need the CAD, just message me.

If you have any other questions, I'm @where'sthelambSAUCE in the Voron discord server.
