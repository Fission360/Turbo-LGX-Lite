# Note: There are two versions of the "Turbo Shroud", one keeps all the features of the original Mini AfterLGX Lite, while the other removes the Klicky mount to make room for better internal ducting. The latter has significantly better air direction than the former, due to the extra room, so choose wisely.

# Print Settings
ABS/ASA is preferred for all of the parts, and I would honestly recommend using a brim at least for Turbo_Mini_AS.stl, since any warping can cause some fitment issues down the road.
The "Duct" needs to be printed at 0.1mm layers with 0.6mm line width for inner and outer perimeters. Go slow with it.
For the "Turbo Shroud", print at 0.16 mm layers for best quality. You will need to ream out the hole for the PTFE a little bit.
